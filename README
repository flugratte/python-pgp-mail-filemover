# Summary
Simple tool to automatically move files between two systems by sending PGP encrypted E-Mails with attachments.

# Why?
I needed to move files scanned by my local printer to a remote server.
My printer did not support scanning to network devices via SFTP or any other encrypted communication.
It would have been possible, to use unsecured FTP to scan directly to a folder on the remote server, but I did not like that idea. 

Thus, I came up with the idea of scanning to a local path on my NAS (which supports running containers) and move it by E-Mail.

I played around a bit with different languages and libraries, until I found the [Envelope](https://github.com/CZ-NIC/envelope) Library/Tool and a neat description on [How to Read Emails in Python](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/reading-emails-in-python).
This massively simplified the effort and after a bit of tinkering, moving stuff to config files and testing. I had a tool with which I could move the files securely.

# How to use?
To use it you need two certificates. You can either use already existing ones, or generate new ones specifically for this task. One for the sending and one for the receiving E-Mail address. The following mentioned key-files have to be provided in ASCII form.

The sender needs the private key for the sending and the public key for the receiving E-Mail address. Both have to be available into the /certs folder of the image.

The receiver needs the private key for the receiving E-Mail address, also in the /certs folder of the container.
 
The remaining configuration for the sender/receiver can be done by either supplying a configured config.ini in the /app-folder of the container, or by supplying the values as environment variables.
